# SortingVisualizer

This is part of an open source project originally aimed at visualizing different sorting algorithms. The original project and its author can be found at https://github.com/Dadadah/sorting-visualization.  
Here, I made several changes to the GUI, increased functionality for the UX/ main thread interaction, added or reimplemented additional sorting algorithms, plus some other code structure and quality changes.
Todo:
  - clear colours when done
