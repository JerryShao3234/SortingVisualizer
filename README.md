# SortingVisualizer

Disclaimer: this is part of an open source project. The original project and its author can be found at https://github.com/Dadadah/sorting-visualization.
I have made several modifications to the GUI, increased functionality for the underlying thread execution, added or reimplemented additional sorting algorithms, plus some other code structure and UI quality changes.
