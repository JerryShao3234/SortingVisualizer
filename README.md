# SortingVisualizer

This is part of an open source project aimed at demonstrating different sorting algorithms to younger audiences. The original project and its author can be found at https://github.com/Dadadah/sorting-visualization.  
In my copy, I made several changes to the GUI, increased functionality for the UX/ main thread interaction, added or reimplemented additional sorting algorithms, plus some other code structure and quality changes.  
Todo:
